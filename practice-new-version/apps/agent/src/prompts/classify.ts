  - course: infer from the mathematics discussed, not from anything the sender states.
    Calculus (derivatives, related rates, integrals, optimization) is math_12; algebra 2 /
    precalculus (logarithms, polynomials, rational functions, trig identities) is math_11.
    Use "none" for staff/admin mail with no course attached.
  - workType: the kind of work referenced, or "none" when the email references no assignment.
  - urgency: high when a deadline or assessment is imminent or a parent is escalating;
    low for FYI mail with no action attached.
